You may certainly have heard of the
[bad things which have happened to Mat Honan](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/). Some hackers deleted almost everything of him. iPhone, iPad, Macbook, Google, hacked his Twitter Account, etcâ€¦ Almost everything could have been prevented if he had used [Google's 2-step Verification](https://plus.google.com/u/0/117377434815709898403/posts/AHaoztNsf3Y). So if you have a Google Account and didn't enable it, go ahead and do it.

But that's not the point of this blogpost. Offering 2-step verification is something which greatly can increase the security of your web application. And I already wrote almost a year ago about a little PHP class I developed for using such a system together with the [Google Authenticator](http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1066447).

Now is the time to implement that in some real life apps. The awareness should be here now. Unfortunately we still couldn't do it somewhere, therefore [the code](https://github.com/chregu/GoogleAuthenticator.php) is still the same and it's still not available as a bundle for Symfony2. But maybe someone out there is up to that task.

And here's the original blogpost about "[2-step verification with Google Authenticator and PHP](http://blog.liip.ch/archive/2011/08/29/2-step-verification-with-google-authenticator-and-php.html)" with some more information about all that.
